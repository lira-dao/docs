## Obtaining SepoliaETH

### Via Faucets:
SepoliaETH can be acquired through faucets specifically designed for the Arbitrum Sepolia network. There are two main methods:

a. **Faucets on Arbitrum Sepolia:**

While several faucets exist, it's important to note that the first one listed tends to provide more significant rewards compared to the others.
Here are some faucet links:
- [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/arbitrum-sepolia)
- [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia)
- [Triangle Platform Faucet](https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/arbitrum/sepolia)

b. **Using Sepolia Faucets:**

These faucets distribute Ethereum (ETH) daily, which can then be bridged to SepoliaETH.

### Mining with Faucet PoW:
Another method to obtain SepoliaETH is by mining it through Faucet Proof of Work (PoW). To mine using this faucet, your wallet must have a minimum score of 2 on Gitcoin Passpowrt. You can mine up to 5 SepoliaETH every two days.
