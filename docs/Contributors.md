# Guidelines for Contributing to the Project and Reward Assignment Process

## Contribution Guidelines

LIRA DAO is a crypto ecosystem that encourages community participation in the development of the project. To start contributing, please follow these guidelines:

**GitHub Organization**

- The GitHub organization for LIRA DAO is [lira-dao](https://github.com/lira-dao).
- The main repository of the project is [ecosystem](https://github.com/lira-dao/ecosystem).

Currently, we only accept contributions to the ecosystem repository. In the future, we may open issues on the services repository (the backend), but for now, it is too early.

**How to Become a Contributor**

- Join our Discord:
    - Enter our Discord server and open a support ticket indicating that you want to contribute to the project.
    - You will be added to the dedicated contributors chat and granted the necessary permissions on GitHub for the ecosystem repository.

**Issue Resolution Guidelines**

- Notify your intention to work on an issue:
        - Notify in the dedicated developers channel on Discord or in the comments of the issue that you want to work on the issue.
- Create a new branch:
        - Create a new branch dedicated to resolving the issue. For the branch name, the one suggested by GitHub is fine.
- Open a pull request:
        - After resolving the issue, open a pull request to allow the core team to review the code.
        - Each pull request must refer to a single issue. Do not include multiple issues in one pull request.

## Reward Assignment
Some issues are tagged with bounty. Issues with this tag have a reward in LDT for their resolution.

**Reward Assignment Process**
- Code Review:
        - After the pull request is opened, the code is reviewed by the core team.
        - If the review is positive, the issue is merged into the develop branch and tagged as resolved.
- Deploy to testnet:
        - When the issue is tagged as resolved, it is deployed on testnet usually within a few hours or at most the following day.
- QA Verification:
        - The issue is checked by our QA team. If everything is correct, the issue can be released to production.
        - The contributor who resolved the issue is then eligible to receive the reward.
- Reward Distribution:
        - Communicate your wallet address via a support ticket to receive the reward.

These guidelines aim to facilitate collaboration and ensure that the reward assignment process is clear and transparent for all community contributors. Thank you for your interest in contributing to the LIRA DAO project!
